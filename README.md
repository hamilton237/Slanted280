CyberRunner:
This is the source code for the Garmin watch face "Slanted Outdoors" from the Garmin Connect IQ store.

This was a project for myself. I have no idea if this will interest anyone, but I am putting my code open source so others can use it.
I do not plan on maintaining the code, so I don't want pull requests that I will integrate in my watch face, you can clone it and do whatever you want with it.

Read the license file for details.

This version of CyberRunner's watch face has been updated for AMOLED and higher resolution garmin watches.
