This is the source code for the Garmin watch face "Slanted Outdoors" from the Garmin Connect IQ store.

This was a project for myself. I have no idea if this will interest anyone, but I am putting my code open source so others can use it.
I do not plan on maintaining the code, so I don't want pull requests that I will integrate in my watch face, you can clone it and do whatever you want with it.

Forked by hamilton237 to develop AMOLED version with AOD and other adjustments
